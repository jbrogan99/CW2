    "Academic": "Sarah Anderson",
    "Learning_outcomes": "Weâ€™ve come a long way since a machine with less computing power than a modern desktop PC first took rockets to the moon, with this degree now exploring the advancing theory, design, development and application of computer science. Aimed at those seeking a challenging and evolving career in computational systems you will study programming languages as well as modules underpinned by computation and mathematics theory, leading you beyond software development and programming and into emergent fields such as big data. This requires modelling and analysis skills coupled with technical knowledge to understand and process large data sets. Graduating students will have wide-reaching technical skills and knowledge relevant to many industries."
